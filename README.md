# Load-Prediction
### Note: the codes are jupyter notebooks, if you have problems opening it, please use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)

Predicting peak loads for electricity grid. We have 2 data sets: a high resolution (half-hourly) and a low resolution (~few times a year) data sets. We want to make daily peak-load predictions for the low resolution data set based on the knowledge of the high resolution data.

Note: the data sets publised here, are only the head 10 rows of the original files.
